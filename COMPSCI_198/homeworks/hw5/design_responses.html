                            <p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>It is a very inspirational page which collects a few of the most comtemporary UIUX designs weekly. Firstly, it tells me there must be a lot of resources
                                like this and I could access to them very easily. Moreover, a lot of the ideas in the design examples are just very impressive and creative.</p>
                        </li>

                        <li>
                            <p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
                            <p>I am amazed by the structure of this article. It eliminates all the begining sentences such as "This week we are gonna tallk about......" that usually appears in almost every articles on medium
                                and just dive straightly into the examples. I think it not only save our reading time, but also save the author time for writing it. I found this kind of articles is actually an exciting new business.    
                            </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <p>In 4-5 sentences, please explain which of the inspirations were your favorite, why, and how the interfaces achieved their goal in a unique/delightful manner.</p>
                            <p> My favorite example among all of which showed on the page is the Nike add-to-cart webpage.
                                Before seeing this design, I thought choosing the right size of the item/shoes could only has to be in pain becuase the size buttons were alays very small and difficult to be clicked on. 
                                However, this design shows me that we could replace multiple size butttons with a rolling list. And that not only make the processing of chooing the right number size of your item more intuitive but also become friendly to users across all ages. It not only provides me an example of improving constumers' onling shopping experience
                                but also teaches me the way to select the right type of button lists in general.</p>
