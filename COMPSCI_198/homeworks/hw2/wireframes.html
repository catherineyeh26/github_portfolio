						<li>
							<p>Using the favorite website you chose in homework 1, create a wireframe for one page of it using pen/paper, PowerPoint, or any your tool of choice. (use the 'img' tag!) Make sure to let us know what the name of your website is (Use the 'p' tag!)</p>
							<img src="assets/imgs/wireframe_original.jpeg" />
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Try to improve the website you've chosen, and create a redesigned wireframe of one page for the same website using the principles of visual hierarchy that you learned from the article.</p>

						<li>
							<p>What is the goal of the website? Who is it intended for? How does the design accomplish this? Write 2-3 sentences answering these questions. (Use the 'p' tag again!)</p>
							<p> The goal of Youtube is being a platform on which everyone can upload or get access to the video made by themselves or othes easily.
								It is designed for people in every ages and normally watch a certain type of video, so the website put the "subscriptions" down half of the menu which appears on the left side of users' screens. 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Write 2-3 sentences about what problems your redesign addressed, and how it solved them.</p>
							<p> The current Youtube interface provides keywords suggestions on the top bar and also gives many categories on the left side of the screen, which cause a problelm because 
								there are too many options for the users and so it's easy to loss directions of which kind of video to fucus on. 
								My redesigned version of Youtube interface solved this problem by merging the "categoris box "into the serching keywords bar, making the interface simpler and clearer.  
							</p>
						</li>
						<p><strong>NOTE:</strong> Make sure to include the wireframe images in the website and don't just put it in your assets folder!</p></li>
						<p>Your wireframes should look something like this:</p>
				<img class="img-scaled" src="assets/imgs/wireframe.png"/>
