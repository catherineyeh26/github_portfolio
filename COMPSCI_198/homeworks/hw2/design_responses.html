						<li>
							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned a lot about the importance and usage of white space in design. 
								The white space, or negative space, is not a wasted space, but a place for the reader to breathe in the more important messages designers are delivering.
								It comes in the forms of margins and paddlings, and the size of them are measured in pixels.    </p>
						

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> My favorite part of this article comes when the author wrote down many stakeholders request the majority of their content to be above the fold and then he opposes this idea.
								He argues that more readers are now more and more adapt at scrolling, and as the designers leave more white spaces, the readers will scroll more.
								I like this particular part because he goes beyond the user interfaces and mentions a very comtemporary user experience phenomenon in a way I have not thought before.   
								 </p>
