							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> All the animations on interfaces are based on the physics in real world. For example, objects tend to
								accerlerate and decerlerate so they may move out or in to the screen with unequally distributed speed. Also, 
								the speed of each animiation is affected by the size of the objects and display screens. The bigger the screen, things tends to move slower, but web are exception, which moves in double speed. 
							</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> The part which the author explain the rule of animiation with position/time graphs that are often used in physics. 
								The differences among symmetric, asymmetric, accerleration curve and decerleration curve......become really easy to perceive 
							and understand thinking about how the real things move in real world. And thus these animation tips become very esy to be memorized.</p>
						</li>

						<li>
							<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
							<p> "By changing the curves, you can move the object as similar to the real world as possible." </p>
						</li>
