				<ul>
					<li>
						<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> I learned about different kinds of dark pattern in a even more detailed way that I had read or heard about. 
							Friend Spam, Forced Continuity, Disguised Ads.....etc those concepts and examples not only
						braodened my knowledge about this topic but also give me more awareness and become more careful in my daily use of internet. 
						Personally, I am shocked to know some of my LinkIn dms are spam as well. 
					 </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>What was your favorite part of this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
						<p> My favorite part is definitely the 2016 US election. I had learned about the concept of comfirmation 
							bias in my Intro to Psychology, but had never thought about this is also about evil UIUX designs.
						I had the idea that dark patterns are not only bringing companies more profits, but also an crucial keys to other areas such as
						politics, environmental protections, and mental health. </p>
					</li>

					<li>
						<p>Copy and paste a quote you found compelling, interesting, or cool</p>
						<p> I believe that as user experience designers we need to think beyond providing aesthetics and usability to our users. We help shape the lives of people everywhere and our decisions can have significant impacts on the way we as a society behave. Giving in to dark patterns for meeting short-term goals is not the solution.</p>
