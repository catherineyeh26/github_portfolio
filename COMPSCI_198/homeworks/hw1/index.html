            <p> Hi! My name is Catherine and welcome to call my nickname Cathy. I like arts in forms of films and nature. 
                In my free time, like to walk to the Clark Kerr trail and enjoy the beautiful sunset view of San Fancisco.</p>

            <p>Reading responses</p>
            <ul>
            <li>I learned a way in which we could train our product design/user experience design eyes. A very easy and accessible method to grow self-teach knowledge about interfaces design on a daily basis.  </li>
            <li>My favorite part of this article is where the writer demonstrate the layout of each app by animations. It is a really eyes-opening way to help us view the designs from a different aspect. </li>
            <li>"I wonder how many iterations they tried with Dates and Guests only being visible at a later point in the flow. I’m sure many designs have gone through explorations where the Dates aren’t presented until you select a location. This makes me curious about how people search and when they introduce filters to their searches."</li>  
            <li>8.5/10</li> 
            </ul>
