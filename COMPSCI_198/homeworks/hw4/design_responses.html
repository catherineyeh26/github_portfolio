							<p>What is something you learned from this article? (3-4 sentences)</p>
							<p> I learned about color accessibility. I have never heard of this term, and the concept behind it broadens my view on the art of choosing a color. The color contrast 
								between background and text is the most iportant one.
								I also learned about a lot of useful UI tools that can help people pick the roight color.   </p>
